# Data-Analyst-Intern-Assessment
This project involved cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing a real-world booking dataset for a multi-service business. I built an interactive dashboard, documented data issues and solutions, and provided key business insights through EDA and SQL.


## **Project Overview**

This project was completed as part of a Data Analyst Intern Assessment. It involved working with a real-world, raw dataset from a multi-service business offering class bookings, facility rentals, subscriptions, and birthday party reservations. The primary goal was to demonstrate skills in data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), SQL querying, data visualization, and business insights generation.

The dataset included common real-world issues such as missing values, inconsistencies, and inaccuracies, providing an opportunity to showcase strong problem-solving and data wrangling abilities.


## **Objectives**

Perform thorough data cleaning to handle missing, duplicate, and inconsistent data.

Conduct EDA to uncover trends, patterns, and key metrics.

Create an interactive Power BI dashboard for visual storytelling.

Write SQL queries to derive insights.

Document data issues and the methods used to resolve them.

Deliver actionable business recommendations based on the findings. 




## **Deliverables**

📊 Power BI Dashboard: An interactive visualization summarizing key insights.

📝 Python Notebook (.ipynb): Complete data cleaning and analysis script using Pandas and SQL.

📂 Cleaned Dataset (Cleaned_Data.csv): The final processed data ready for analysis.

📃 Documentation: Detailed explanation of the cleaning process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

🎥 Video Walkthrough: A short video explanation of the dashboard and insights (not hosted here).
